    Two type of programing language.
            1.POP -> Procedurel Oriented Programming.
            2.OOP -> Object Oriented Programming.

    History of C++ :
            > Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
            > In bell laboratories.
            > IN 1980.

<h1>3. OOP CONCEPT </h1>

        > Definition OOP :

            > It is one type of concept.
            > it is a concept in which code becomes well               
            structrized , well organized and in creases it's
            resusability.
            > every process will be done using Object. 
       
        > 4 Principles of OOP :-

            1.Encapsulation (To combine).
            2.Inheritence (to share).
            3.Ploymorphsim.
            4.Data abstraction.

<h1>5. Data Encapulation  </h1>

                -> What is Data Encapulation :-
                        To wrap the code into resuablr methods of class   
                        convert UDFs into, Data member function and convert 
                        variables into data members is calles encapulation.
                        -Wrap every logic into the class.

                -> Setter & Getter :-
                        Setter : A method to take input of all or specific  
                        attributes.
                        Getter :- Amethod to give output of all or specific 
                        attributes.
                -> This keyword :- 
                        it defferenciates the class level varriable from 
                        function level variables.
                -> Static :- 
                        common method for all objects, which is can be  
                        accessed by name using scope  resultion.   
                -> Static Member :- 
                        Common member for all objects which takes the single 
                        memory all0cation.
                        - for all the objects, static member will common  
                        and only one.    
                -> Friend Funcation :- 
                        -it is mainly used to access private attributes of class.
                        -we have to declare friend in class's body.
                        -it must be defind in global area.
                -> Two type of Friend Funcation :-
                        1.Default
                        2.parameterized.

                -> Constructor & Destructor 
                        Constructor : it is block of code which is 
                        automatlically invoked(Run) when class is instaniated.
                -> Rule to create Constructor : 
                        - it's name must be same as class's name.
                        - it must not have any return dat type.
                        - it must not return any value.
                -> Type of Constructor :
                        1.Default
                        2.Parameterized
                        3.Copy :
                                1.Implict 
                                2.Explict

                        Destructor : A block of code which is automatically 
                        invoked when object is destoyed or deleted.

<h1>6. Inheritance  </h1>

                Inheritance :- 
                        Share attributes and methodes from one class to a
                        nother class.

                        - Super class == Base Class    == Parent Class.
                        - Sub  class  == Derived class == Child class.

                -> Type Of Inheritance :-
                        1.Single level 
                        2.Multi level 
                        3.Hierarchical
                        4.Multiple
                        5.Hybrid.

                -> Ambiguity :-
                        - it occcures when we tries to access some data from 
                        two different source which are not directly 
                        connected to each other.
                        - it mainly occures in multiple and Hireachical 
                        Inheritence.
                        - there are two different ways to reslove the ambiguity.
                        
                        - Temperory solution :
                                using scope resolution operataor.
                        - perement Solution :
                                using virtual function.
